## Overview

Quizroller is a proof of concept game developed to showcase the potential of 3D web for educational experiences.

The core mechanic is pretty simple, you navigate your marble over terrain, answering multiple choice questions as you go.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**
- **React Three Fiber** _for 3D rendering_
- **Rapier** _for physics simulation and collision events_
- **WebGL** _for custom materials and effects_
- **Zustand** _for state management_
- **GSAP** _for animations_
- **Tailwind** _for UI styling_

## Colour Palette

![Palette](https://github.com/prag-matt-ic/quiz-roller/blob/main/public/screenshots/palette.jpg?raw=true)

Colours are driven by a [cosine gradient palette](https://iquilezles.org/articles/palettes/).
In theory, the entire theme of the app can be changed by adjusting the 4 gradient input vectors.

There are helpers in GLSL and TypeScript to retrieve colours using an input value of 0-1.

I've also created a "texure generator" page which was used to produce the background image.

## State Management

Most of the game logic is encapsulated within the `GameProvider` which is a Zustand store initialised into React Context.

The Game Store handles the current stage, questions, player positioning and collision/intersection events.

### Fast Value Subscriptions

I've avoided setting React State as much as possible to keep the experience snappy.

For frequently updated values such as the player position, the value is captured in a ref, and then read inside `useFrame`.

The following pattern is utilised a few times:

```ts
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'
import { Vector3 } from 'three'

import { useGameStoreAPI } from '@/components/GameProvider'

export function usePlayerPosition(onPlayerPositionChange?: (pos: Vector3) => void) {
  const gameStoreAPI = useGameStoreAPI()

  // Capture current value in a ref to avoid re-renders
  const playerPosition = useRef<Vector3>(gameStoreAPI.getState().playerWorldPosition)

  useEffect(() => {
    // Subscribe to store updates and update ref only when playerPosition changes
    const unsubscribe = gameStoreAPI.subscribe((state, prevState) => {
      if (state.playerWorldPosition === prevState.playerWorldPosition) return
      playerPosition.current = state.playerWorldPosition
      onPlayerPositionChange?.(playerPosition.current)
    })
    return unsubscribe
  }, [gameStoreAPI, onPlayerPositionChange])

  // Fire once on mount so consumers can initialize uniforms/refs immediately.
  useEffect(() => {
    onPlayerPositionChange?.(playerPosition.current)
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, [])

  return { playerPosition }
}
```

## Player

The player is a Rapier kinematic sphere with a `BallCollider`.

### Making it roll!

Depending on whether the device is mobile or not, different controls are rendered:

- Desktop: WASD/Arrow keys
- Mobile: a virtual touch joystick

Movement is applied each frame, with gravity keeping the marble planted on raised tiles.
The rotation animation is derived from the player velocity and helps the movement feel natural.

### Collisions and Confirmations

Rapier sensors mark interactive surfaces: info zone, start tile, answer tiles, colour tiles, and out‑of‑bounds.

For answers, entering a sensor triggers a GSAP‑driven confirmation timer. Exiting before the timer completes cancels the choice. When the timer completes, the choice is confirmed.

When the player enters an info zone, HTML content is animated in.

If the player falls off the edge, they intersect with out-of-bounds and it resets their position or transitions to the 'game over' stage.

### Colour Config

![Player Colour](https://github.com/prag-matt-ic/quiz-roller/blob/main/public/screenshots/player-colour.jpg?raw=true)

The user can change their marble colour by rolling over one of the colour picker tiles.

Colour selection is band‑based (a range between 0 and 1 for sampling the gradient palette) and is persisted in the game store.

### Marble Shading

The marble uses a custom GLSL material that samples the cosine palette using the player's chosen colour.

It supports textured and flat modes depending on performance settings.

## Infinite Platform

![Platform](https://github.com/prag-matt-ic/quiz-roller/blob/main/public/screenshots/platform.jpg?raw=true)

The main `Platform` is formed from a group of instanced rigid bodies (grid of rows × columns) that endlessly wrap forward.

### Row Recycling

When a row passes the camera, it wraps to the back and is assigned new 'row data'. This approach means the camera can look at the player, whilst the floor moves like a conveyor beneath it.

Limiting the number of rendered rows, and using instanced meshes ensure optimal performance.

### Surface Elements

Each stage (Home, Obstacles, Question) has it's own set of elements which are positioned atop the tiles. These elements include the question text, answer tiles and player colour picker.

Their positioning is defined within the row data. When their corresponding row is raised, the element is positioned.

The translation (Z movement) of surface elements is synced with the movement of the underlying tiles so they appear fixed to the tiles.

### Tile Shader

The platform tiles use a custom GLSL shader to colour the tiles, fade in/out and highlight those near the player.

## Questions and Answers

![Question](https://github.com/prag-matt-ic/quiz-roller/blob/main/public/screenshots/question.jpg?raw=true)

Questions are chosen to avoids repeats where possible and shuffle the answer positions.

Each question has a difficulty rating of 1-3. Every two correct answers, the difficulty increases.

### Answer Selection

![Answer](https://github.com/prag-matt-ic/quiz-roller/blob/main/public/screenshots/answer.jpg?raw=true)

- A HUD indicator briefly shows correct (✅) or incorrect (❌)
- A short particle burst plays, with a correct answer attracting green particles to the player, and an incorrect answer dispersing orange particles.
- The chosen answer is recorded in `confirmedAnswers`

## Floating Background Tiles

![FloatingTiles](https://github.com/prag-matt-ic/quiz-roller/blob/main/public/screenshots/floating-tiles.jpg?raw=true)

Decorative floating tiles add depth and motion around the course. They are rendered as a single instanced mesh and animated entirely on the GPU using `GPUComputationRenderer`.

- Tiles are placed in a grid formation around the platform, they spawn at a low Y value and float upward, respawning at the bottom once they hit a threshold.
- The whole effect is disabled at low quality by setting the instance count to zero.

## Performance Optimisations

The site achieves great performance even on mobile.

- My Macbook Pro M4 achieves a consistent 120fps on high quality mode.
- My iPhone 15 Pro gets a steady 60fps also on high quality mode.

_(I appreciate these are top-of-the-range devices, but lower powered machines also achieve 60fps.)_

### Adaptive Quality

Visual quality is managed by a small Zustand store `PerformanceProvider`. It exposes a `sceneQuality` mode (High/Medium/Low) and a derived `sceneConfig` which is used across components to scale the detail and reduce GPU work.

The canvas is wrapped in Drei’s `PerformanceMonitor`. It monitors FPS and calls `onIncline`/`onDecline`, which in turn invokes `onPerformanceChange` from the provider to step quality up or down.

### Debug Mode

Adding `?debug=true` to the URL inserts the Drei Stats component for displaying FPS, and exposes manual quality and DPR controls.

If you manually change quality in debug tools, auto‑adjustments are paused.

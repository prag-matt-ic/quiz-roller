## Task

Use the following Clean Code Checklist to review and refactor the current file's code.

Begin first by identifying any violations of the checklist items. Then, refactor the code to address these issues.

## Checklist

- [ ] Use meaningful names – variable and function names should clearly communicate what the code does. Avoid abbreviations or cryptic identifiers; clear naming makes the code self‑documenting. Boolean variables should be named to imply true/false (e.g. isVisible, hasItems). Don't add unecessary prefixes or suffixes - e.g do not add 'Ref' to a useRef variable.

- [ ] Be consistent – use the same vocabulary for the same type of entity (e.g. always call the current player position playerPos instead of mixing currentPos, position, and pos).

- [ ] Write small, pure functions – each function should have a single responsibility. Break complex logic into smaller helpers rather than nesting conditionals.

- [ ] If a function has 3 or more parameters, use an object to group them - this makes it easier to understand what each parameter means.

- [ ] Prefer early returns over deep nesting – return early to avoid if/else pyramids.

- [ ] Prefer immutability – never mutate objects or arrays directly. When updating state, return new objects instead of modifying existing ones.

- [ ] Avoid magic numbers and strings – declare constants (e.g. LANE_COUNT = 3) so that values are descriptive and changeable. The exception to this rule is animation timing values (e.g. duration: 0.5, delay: 0.2) which can be left as literals.

- [ ] Comment judiciously – write code that is self‑explanatory. When comments are needed, make them precise and consider using // TODO to mark work that should be improved later.

- [ ] Avoid creating expensive objects/classes in loops or animation frames - reuse objects where sensible to reduce garbage collection. For example: never create a new Vector3() inside useFrame().

- [ ] Review imports and ensure that types/interfaces are imported as types (e.g import { type MyType } from '...' ). Classes should not be marked as types. Remove any unused imports.

- [ ] For event handlers, use the onSubjectAction naming convention (e.g. 'onGameOverClick' or 'onEnquiryFormSubmit') rather than handleSubjectAction.
